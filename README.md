# Roommate+
## Project Goal
This project aims to provide assistant to help housing units with multiple roommates manage their shared responsibilities and provide mean to communicate and resolve problems in regards to common roommates problem directly through app
## Problem At Hand
### Problem Statement
As more international students come to Canada to study post secondary programs, there is an increasing demand for shared housing. These students are typically sharing house with strangers for the first time and there is a need for a centralized house management system that tracks all the chores and assist with problem resolutions.
### Statistical Data
To validate our hypothesis, we send out a form to ask about students' experience with roommates and have 32 anonymous responses.
Here is the list of most noticable data:
1. Over 60% of the responses stated they have 1 to 2 roommates to share their house with
2. The main concern they have with their roommates are:
  1. Chores Management
  2. Hygiene Concern
  3. Communication
3. The main way to resolve problems according to the respondents is through communication
4. 50% expressed the need to use a mobile app to manage their house
## Solution
To solve the problems and concerns from the data collected, we implement the following features to help resolve them:
- Feature 1
  - Have a chores page that display everyone's responsibilities in form of widget.
- Feature 2
  - Have a thread based communication page where they can discuss and resolve each of their problems
    - Each discussion will be their own post
    - Conversation will be within this thread
  - There will be an AI model that summarize the conversation
- Feature 3
  - Have a page to let users know which machines are occupied/free in the house
